## History

The Black-Scholes Model, developed in 1973 by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton, revolutionized the pricing of options contracts and laid the foundation for modern quantitative finance.

- **Origins:** Fischer Black and Myron Scholes collaborated to solve the problem of pricing options contracts, with significant contributions from Robert Merton.
- **Nobel Prize:** Myron Scholes and Robert Merton were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for their work on the Black-Scholes model.

## Formula

The Black-Scholes formula is used to calculate the theoretical price of European-style call and put options on non-dividend paying stocks.
